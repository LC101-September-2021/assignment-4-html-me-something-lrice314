               <p> Eminence, the county seat of Shannon County, is nestled in the heart of the Missouri Ozark hills. It is a very small, quaint town with a population of about 600 residents. Eminence was listed as “the top outdoor sports town in Missouri” in Sports Afield Magazine and as “one of the top 50 sports towns in the country.” The crystal clear Jack’s Fork River flows through the middle of town and, along with the nearby Current River, attracts thousands of floaters and campers each year. Both rivers have beautiful, scenic views, an abundance of fish, and numerous opportunities to see many different types of wildlife. You might even catch a glimpse of our famous wild horses.</p>
